# CompliSpace Technical Test
## Toy Robot Simulator
Just simplely run `node app.js` to start the simulator.
I used input file as an input of the simulator, and I provided some test data in it.

## Some thoughts
Initially I setup a .env file to set the size of the board. But I read the description that shows it is a 5 x 5 board, so I deleted it.
